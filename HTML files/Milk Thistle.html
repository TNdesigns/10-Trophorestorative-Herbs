        <h4 style="border-style:solid; border-width:10px; border-color:dodgerblue;">At least 10 times as powerful as vitamin E, silymarin helps increase levels of two additional antioxidants, glutathione and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Surprisingly, other than protective activity, silymarin can help the liver in repairing injured cells and generating new ones, by stimulating protein synthesis through the enzyme RNA polymerase I. Silymarin's regenerative ability has been reported for treating serious conditions such as toxic fatty deposits in the liver, cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis. Recent evidence suggests that silymarin may be just as important for kidney health as for liver. Silymarin concentrates in kidney cells, where it aids in repairing and regeneration by increasing protein and nucleic acid synthesis. One study suggested that it increased cell replication by 25 to 30 percent which were related to silybin and silychristin, two important components of silymarin. Studies have shown the beneficial effects of silymarin in diabetic nephropathy. The results of published studies show that silymarin might be effective for prevention of nephropathy-induced premature death in diabetic patients. Silymarin has also been found to be effective in reducing proteinuria in type 2 diabetes patients with overt nephropathy in a randomized controlled trial. This reduction in proteinuria was related to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of silymarin. Silymarin could reduce urinary excretion of albumin, TNF-Î±, and malondialdehyde in patients with diabetic kidney disease</h4>
